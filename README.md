This is a test. I am new to JS and I am looking for a way to solve a 3d equation.
Here, I implemented a way to solve it over a 3D dimention. 
I've only tested this by solving for z, so this is likely broken for x,y but can be easily fixed.
My main issue is that this is too slow. I need a solution on doing the same task, but quickly and efficiently.
