This is a test. I am new to JS. I am looking for a way to solve a 3d equation. I implemented a way to solve it over a 3D dimention. 
I've only tested this by solving for z, so otherways might be broken but can be easily fixed.
The problem is, this is too slow, I need ideas on doing the same task, but quickly and efficiently.
